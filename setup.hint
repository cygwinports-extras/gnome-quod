sdesc: "Gnome Quod game"
ldesc: "Quod has simple rules, but playing well requires sophisticated 
strategy. The goal of the game is to place pieces on a grid so that they 
make a square. The player who makes a square first wins. Squares can be 
any size and orientation, and players have a limited supply of blocking 
pieces, which adds to the complexity and interest."
